  ## Description
  This is a backend server configured for use with a social network. All end points are functional and allow the options to create users and thoughts, add friends, and react to thoughts. Users and thoughts can be modified/updated, and you can view all users/thoughts or choose to view specific queries, with the ability to delete all reactions, friends, thoughts and users. 

  Created using mongodb and node.js, utilizing the express package and mongoose - an npm that allows easier operation and access of mongoose databases to perform CRUD operations on the server.
